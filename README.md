Project description: 
You and the members of your group have been hired by an IT company that wants to expand. After careful
consideration of the factors, and after consulting with potential clients, the company has decided to open up a new
office. The new office does not have any suitable network infrastructure apart from a single ISP fibre connection and
ONT, and the company has given you the task of setting up the new office network in the new building. You have to
design the network in such a way that the costs are kept to a minimum, and satisfies all of the requirements that the
company has put in place.

Outlines:
• Use CISCO Packet Tracer to design a network setup that addresses the needs shown in the attached diagram.
• Focus on building a robust, yet affordable, network.
• Each section has to be isolated.
• Each section must have Internet connectivity. There is only one Internet access point.
• The printers in each section should be accessible over the network.
• The network in each section should be representative of the perceived network needs of the section.
• The network must be able to accommodate the growth as shown.
• The overall cost should be kept as low as possible.
• Your Packet Tracer file must provide proper simulation of the network
• Determine appropriate subnets, IP addresses, and routing setups, where appropriate.
• Include, if needed, additional hardware for a virtual office environment.
